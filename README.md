This is the code for SwarmSports - a sports news aggregator

SwarmSports is a sports news RSS aggregator with a ranking system called ViralRank. 

The code here is a simple framework like code - /content /logic. You need an installation of Bootstrap to get this to appear correctly.

It's still running as a ghost site here - http://swarmsports.com/

The code here is not the latest version, but a version that was zipped up and does work with some tweaking. 

Enjoy - and SwarmSports can be used for any industry, not limited to sports news. Any place that distributes via RSS.
